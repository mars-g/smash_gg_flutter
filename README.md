# smash_gg

A flutter application to interface with the smash.gg api. It is intended to be a published app with all the core functionality of the smash.gg website.

Right now, there is no ability to login and a couple of other minor features are either not implemented, or simply link to a chrome webview of smash.gg to view. I will be continually updating this app until all features that can be added are.
